## An R package for processing crab data

This is an R package that focuses on manipulating crab data such as carapce measurements,
latitude found, and color. This package contains functions that allow the user to omit missing values in data, manipulate 
units of measurement,calculate the carapace area of an object, to create a 
linear model and plot the linear model on a point graph. 
Crabbers, fishers, and researchers may be interested in this package and in being able to 
graph data regarding crabs, find the relationship between characteristics of a 
crab, and quickly compare measurements using one uniform unit of measurement. test for push, thanks.
